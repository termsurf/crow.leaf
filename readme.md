### Welcome

The [`wolf.link`](https://github.com/teamtreesurf/wolf.link) library is one possible implementation of this interface. The goal of separating `moon.link` from `wolf.link` is so that one could theoretically develop an optimal version of the implementation in parallel to a basic implementation, then swap them out, without interferring with the main library interface. This `moon.link` library is basically the specification for the standard library. It could also be used in other programming languages as it doesn't have any implementation.

### TreeSurf

This is being developed by the folks at [TreeSurf](https://drum.work), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. TreeSurf started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a moon of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teamtreesurf), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamtreesurf), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teamtreesurf). Check out our other GitHub projects as well!
